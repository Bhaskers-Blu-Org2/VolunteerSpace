# Volunteer Space Manifesto

## What is our goal?
Connect volunteers and non-profits in a way that would maximize the impact of their work in the society.

## Who Volunteer Space is for?
For non-profits who want to find, engage and manage volunteers to drive impact in the society with their help.
For volunteers who want to contribute their time and skills to drive meaningful impact in the society.

## What problems are we solving?
Maximize engagement of the volunteers.
Maximize productivity of the volunteers. 
Minimize the overhead.

## How are we solving these problems?
_Maximize engagement_
* Elicit meaning in the volunteer work.
* Provide visibility to the impact.
* Create a community and a movement.

_Maximize productivity_
* Connect the right people with the right skills to the right job for maximum impact.

_Minimize the overhead_
* Automate and simplify finding, engaging and managing volunteers.
* Automate and simplify finding non-profits and signing up for volunteer work.

## What are our value propositions?

### For non-profits
* Finding the best candidates for maximum impact 
  * For a given event/task, non-profits are able to specify the desired skills, experience and other pre-requisites to engage the right candidates for the job. The match is optimized for maximizing the impact.
* Finding the optimal date/time for maximum participation
  * For a given event/task, the system provides the optimal dates/times when the max number of matching candidates are available
* Hassle free engagements
  * Once an event/task is created the system automatically seeks out and engages volunteers, automatically handling signups, reminders, cancellations, re-signups, wait-listing, appropriate nagging, etc.
* Facilitating meaningful engagements
  * The system guides and helps non-profits in quantifying and measuring the impact of volunteer engagements. The system passes the impact information to volunteers so that they have a meaningful, ongoing and lasting engagements with the non-profit.
* Creating a following
  * On special occasions, and as part of special drives, non-profits can register volunteers as affiliated volunteers. Affiliated volunteers stay connected with the non-profit by automatically receiving updates and getting notified of new volunteer opportunities.
  * Already registered volunteers themselves can declare affiliation to a non-profit to stay connected with the non-profit.
* Building a movement
  * The system encourages and facilitates social connections between volunteers; spreading the news, promoting a cause, pulling in friends, signing up together.
		
### For volunteers

* Intelligent Matches
  * Volunteers can specify the causes they care about, the areas/locations that suits them, the days/times that work for them, and other preferences they have. The system saves the preferences and honors them, sparing volunteers from the clutter and showing only those volunteer opportunities that match their preferences.
  * When allowed to access user calendar, the system can suppress the matches that conflict with user calendar. 
* Hassle free engagements
  * Easy signups, reminders, cancellations, wait-listing, etc.
* Meaningful engagements
  * Before signing up for a volunteer opportunity, volunteers can get a clear and precise view of how their volunteer work will support the cause that they care about and what the impact of their volunteer work is going to be in the society.
* Tracking impact
  * Volunteers can track the hours they have volunteered for various causes, and the impact their work has had in the society.
  * Volunteers can set their quarterly/yearly impact goals. Volunteer Space can notify them of coming volunteer opportunities that can help them meet those goals.
* Maximizing impact
  * Volunteers can connect their LinkedIn account to Volunteer Space. Volunteer Space can then access their skills and experience from LinkedIn and use this information to recommend volunteer opportunities that would maximize the impact of their work in the society.
  * Volunteers can set their annual impact goals, and the system helps them meet the goal by notifying them of the volunteer opportunities to meet the impact goal.
* Impact Statement
  * Volunteers can make the impact of their volunteer work known to the world.
  * Volunteer Space profile will include an impact statement. The impact statement summarizes the impact of their work in the society. Impact statement can be made public if a volunteer choses to do so. Volunteers can:
    * Include the impact statement in their resume
    * Post their impact statement on Facebook
    * Show their impact statement in their LinkedIn profile
* Social Connections
  * Volunteers can connect to other like-minded people through volunteer work. Volunteer Space will facilitate such connections by allowing volunteers to send Facebook friend request and LinkedIn connection request to other volunteers who had participated in the same volunteer event.
  * Volunteers can post their coming volunteer sign-ups on Facebook and invite their friends to join in.
  * Volunteers can send a challenge to their Facebook friends with their impact score and invite them to beat it.
* Following favorite non-profits
  * Volunteers can follow their favorite non-profits by declaring affiliation with them. Affiliated volunteers stay connected with the non-profits they are following, by automatically receiving updates and getting notified of new volunteer opportunities from them.
		
### For Enterprises

* Customized Volunteer Portal
  * Enterprises will get a Volunteer Portal which they can customize and integrate with their match offerings. 
* Hassel free automatic matches
  * Volunteers can declare their participating employers for the matches, or it will be inferred from their connected LinkedIn accounts. 
  * Volunteers will not have to manually file a match request with their employer.
  * Match requests will automatically get triggered by Volunteer Space at the completion of confirmed volunteer engagements through Volunteer Space. 
  * Volunteer engagements are confirmed by the non-profits to receive the match.
* Impact based matching
  * Since Volunteer Space quantifies and measures the impact of volunteer work, enterprises may choose to match volunteer work based on the impact instead of just the hours.
* Enterprise Impact Statement
  * When employees of a company volunteer through Volunteer Space with their LinkedIn accounts connected to Volunteer Space, the impact of their volunteer work is aggregated and summarized as Enterprise Impact Statement on company's LinkedIn page.
  * Enterprises known for the high social impact of their employees may attract more socially responsible employees. This may prove beneficial for company culture and productivity of its employees.
